# Shinjuku

Shinjuku is a board game where you build department stores in Tokyo and the rail lines so that
customers can get to your stores.

_Note: This is a work in progress_

The map contains train stations where you can build your stores.

During your turn, you can choose 2 of the following actions:

* Play a card and build a store in that location.
* Build new track that connects to one of your stores or to your existing track.
* Play a card to lure customers to your stores.
* Draw new cards.

Or you can spend both actions to:

* Expand one of your existing stores.

New customers are added randomly to the board each turn.

Cards are drawn:

And the customers appear in that region of Tokyo.

When you choose to "lure" customers to your store, they can start from any of the train stations in that region.
