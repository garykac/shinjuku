# Shinjuku

Shinjuku is a board game where you build department stores in Tokyo and the rail lines so that
customers can get to your stores.

**Note: This game is a work in progress**

## The Map

The map contains train stations where you can build your stores.

Each station has a set of potential connections to other stations and a maximum build height for stores (1, 2, or 3 dots).

## The Cards

There are 23 different cards – one for each ward (区 or _ku_) in Tokyo.
There are multiple copies of each card based on the population of that ward.

## Play

During your turn, you can:

* Play a card from your hand and then:
  * Build a store at any empty station in that ward.
  * Upgrade a store that you have in that ward.
  * Lure customers from that ward to stores, following train tracks to connected stations.
* Build new track that connects to one of your stores or to your existing track.
* Discard and draw new cards into your hand.

## Customers

New customers are added randomly to the board each turn. Cards are drawn and the customers appear in that ward of Tokyo.

When you choose to "lure" customers to your store, they can start from any of the train stations in that ward.

## Wildcards

Once you build a station in a ward, the cards for that ward become wildcards for you.
You can use your wildcards to match any ward.

Because the card frequency varies based on the population of that ward, some cards work better
as wildcards (because you're more likely to encounter them).
