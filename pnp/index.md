## Component Info

### 1 Map of Tokyo

The map is 18"x20" (457mm x 508mm). The low-ink Black and White version uses patterns to differentiate the wards. You can print this out as a single large image, or as split across 6 pages:

* Shinjuku Map - Single large image - [B&W](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/pnp/shinjuku-pnp/map-bw.jpg), [Color](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/pnp/shinjuku-pnp/map-color.jpg)
* Shinjuku Map - Split across 6 pages - B&W ([Letter](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/pnp/shinjuku-pnp/map-bw-letter.pdf), [A4](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/pnp/shinjuku-pnp/map-bw-a4.pdf)), Color ([Letter](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/pnp/shinjuku-pnp/map-color-letter.pdf), [A4](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/pnp/shinjuku-pnp/map-color-a4.pdf))

### 72 Ward Cards

There are 72 cards and each card identifies a single ward on the map.

* Shinjuku Cards - 8 pages, 9 cards per page - B&W ([Letter](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/pnp/shinjuku-pnp/cards-bw.pdf), [A4](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/pnp/shinjuku-pnp/cards-bw-a4.pdf)), Color ([Letter](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/pnp/shinjuku-pnp/cards-color.pdf), [A4](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/pnp/shinjuku-pnp/cards-color-a4.pdf))

### 52 Customers

Each customer is a white 15mm x 10mm cylinder. This size works well because the pieces are easy to pick up and move around on the board, and the 15mm diameter easily accepts the 1/2" stickers to mark each customer.

* 15x10mm Cylinders - [PrintPlayGames](https://www.printplaygames.com/product/15mm-x-10mm-cylinders/)
* 14x10mm Cylinder - [TheGameCrafter](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/parts/disc-14mm-x-10mm-white) - smaller than 15mm, but still should work with 1/2" stickers

Alternately, you can use any 52 pieces that are all the same size and can be marked with the 4 customer symbols.

If you're marking the pieces yourself (rather than using printed 1/2" stickers), the distribution of customers is as follows:

* 17 customers who want **food** (marked with a ◯)
  * **11 regular** food customers and **6 double** food customers
* 14 customers who want **clothing** (marked with a ⤫)
  * **9 regular** clothing customers and **5 double** clothing customers
* 12 customers who want **books** (marked with a △)
  * **8 regular** book customers and **4 double** book customers
* 9 customers who want **electronics** (marked with a ☆)
  * **6 regular** electronics customers and **3 double** electronics customers

The “double” customers should be marked with a small “2” to distinguish them from the regular customers.

### 32 Stores (8 stores x 4 player colors)

Each store is a 15mm x 4mm disk in one of 4 colors: red, blue, green and yellow. This size works well for stores because the customers can rest on top of them during the Move action and the diameter easily accepts the 1/2" stickers to mark each store.

These are fairly easy to find:

* 15x15x4mm wood discs - [PrintPlayGames](https://www.printplaygames.com/product/15mm-wood-discs/), [BoardGamesMaker](https://www.boardgamesmaker.com/print/fi-8817.html), [TheGameCrafter](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/parts/disc-15mm-x-4mm-red)

Alternately, you can use any 32 pieces that are all the same size and can be marked with the 4 customer symbols.

If you're marking the pieces yourself (rather than using printed 1/2" stickers), there should be 2 stores of each type (◯, ⤫, △, ☆) for each player.

### 12 department stores (3 department stores x 4 player colors)

The can be basically any piece that matches the player color. The pieces used in the prototypes are:

* 15mm x 30mm tall cylinders - [TheGameCrafter](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/parts/cylinder-30mm-x-15mm-blue?dept_uri=game-pieces&dept_name=Game%20Pieces)

### 64 track (16 track x 4 player colors)

These are standard 25mm x 4mm prisms (or "sticks"), 16 in each of the 4 player colors. Borrow these from your Settlers of Catan game (you'll be 1 short per color, but that's only needed for 2p) or you can get them here:

* Wood Roads/Sticks - [PrintPlayGames](https://www.printplaygames.com/product/25mm-x-5mm-x-5mm-wood-roads/), [TheGameCrafter](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/parts/stick-wood-black)

Alternately, you can use any stick-like piece that is 25mm or shorter in length. Longer pieces might work, but you may have trouble fitting the track between some stations on the board.

### 1 bag

The bag is used to hold all the customers so that they can be drawn at random. Use any bag you feel like.

* Cloth bag - [PrintPlayGames](https://www.printplaygames.com/product/cloth-bag/)

### 4 player screens (1 screen x 4 player colors)

These player screens have the rules summarized on the inside. 

* Player Screens - 4 double-sided pages - Color ([Letter](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/pnp/shinjuku-pnp/screens.pdf), [A4](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/pnp/shinjuku-pnp/screens-a4.pdf))

## Customer and Store Stickers

The Customer tokens and the Store tokens need to have matching symbols. You can write them manually (using ◯, ⤫, △, ☆), or you can print out these stickers to apply to the tokens listed above.

### 1 sticker sheet

The stores and customers are each labeled with a 1/2" round sticker:

* [Blank sheet of 154 round stickers 1/2" (Avery - Letter)](https://www.avery.com/templates/presta-94503)
* [Image to print on sticker sheet (Letter)](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/pnp/shinjuku-pnp/stickers.pdf)

For A4, there are typically 216 13mm round stickers, packed more tightly on the page:

* [Image to print on sticker sheet (A4)](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/pnp/shinjuku-pnp/stickers-a4.pdf)

Note that there is 1 sticker for each customer token and 2 stickers for each store token (to label the front and back). Labelling both sides of the stores is optional, but it helps speed up the initial setup a bit by eliminating the need to flip over the stores that land upside-down.

## Expansions

For the Expansions, there are 5 cards to print out. These allow you to randomly select expansions for play and also summarize the expansion rules.

* Shinjuku Expansion Pack I Cards - 1 page, 5 cards ([Letter](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/pnp/shinjuku-pnp/expansions-1.pdf), [A4](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/pnp/shinjuku-pnp/expansions-1-a4.pdf))

### Wandering Princess

The Princess marker can be any token you like as long as it is easily distinguishable from other tokens in the game.

### Sneaky Thief

Because the Thief tokens are placed in the bag with the rest of the Customer tokens, they need to exactly match the 15x10mm tokens.

On the sticker sheet, the Thief tokens have a red ‘x’ on them. If you are labeling them yourself, then add a red ‘.’, ‘x’ or some other mark to identify the thieves.

### Busy Chairman

The four Chairman tokens can be any shape/size as long as there is one for each player color. For the prototype, mini meeples were used:

* Mini Meeples: [PrintPlayGames](https://www.printplaygames.com/product/wood-baby-meeples/), [TheGameCrafter](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/parts/meeple-mini-wood-white)

### Faithful Dog Hachiko

The Hachiko Station Marker should match the Store tokens, although this isn’t absolutely necessary.

The Hachiko marker can be any token you have that Is vaguely dog-like.
If you have access to a laser cutter, you can create your own using the following vector file:

* [Hachiko outline (svg)](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/components/hachiko-laser.svg)

### Angry Kaiju

The Kaiju marker can be any token you have that is somewhat monstrous.
If you have access to a laser cutter, you can create your own using the following vector outline file:

* [Kaiju outline (svg)](https://garykac.github.io/shinjuku/components/kaiju-laser.svg)
