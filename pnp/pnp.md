# Shinjuku - Print-n-Play

To create your own copy of _Shinjuku_ that you can play, you'll need the following:

### 1 Map

The map is 18"x20" (457mm x 508mm):

* Shinjuku Map - [Color](tokyo-map-color.jpg), [B&W](tokyo-map-bw.jpg)

### 72 Cards

There are 72 cards and each card identifies a single ward on the map.

* Shinjuku Cards - [Color](pnp-cards-color.pdf), [B&W](pnp-cards-bw.pdf)

### 52 Customers

Each customer is a white 15mm x 10mm cylinder. This size works well because the pieces are easy to pick up and move around on the board, and the 15mm diameter easily accepts the 1/2" stickers to mark each customer.

* [15x10 Cylinders - PrintPlayGames](https://www.printplaygames.com/product/15mm-x-10mm-cylinders/)
* [14x10 Cylinder - TheGameCrafter](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/parts/disc-14mm-x-10mm-white) - smaller than 15mm, but still should work with 1/2" stickers

Alternately, you can use any 52 pieces that are all the same size and can be marked with the 4 customer symbols.

If you're marking your pieces yourself (rather than using printed 1/2" stickers), the distribution of customers is as follows:

* 19 customers who want food (marked with a ◯)
* 16 customers who want clothing (marked with a ⤫)
* 14 customers who want books (marked with a △)
* 11 customers who want electronics (marked with a ⭒)

### 32 Stores (8 stores x4 player colors)

Each store is a 15mm x 4mm disk in one of 4 colors: red, blue, green and yellow. This size works well for stores because the customers can rest on top of them during the Move action and the diameter easily accepts the 1/2" stickers to mark each store.

These are fairly easy to find:

* [BoardGamesMaker](https://www.boardgamesmaker.com/print/fi-8817.html)
* [TheGameCrafter](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/parts/disc-15mm-x-4mm-red)

Alternately, you can use any 32 pieces that are all the same size and can be marked with the 4 customer symbols.

If you're marking your pieces yourself (rather than using printed 1/2" stickers), there should be 2 stores of each type (◯, ⤫, △, ⭒) for each player.

### 12 department stores (3 dept stores x 4 player colors)

The can be basically any piece that matches the player color.

The pieces used in the prototypes are:

* [City Pieces - PrintPlayGames](https://www.printplaygames.com/product/city-pieces/)

### 64 track (16 track x 4 player colors)

These are standard 25mm x 4mm prisms, 16 in each of the 4 player colors. Borrow these from your _Settlers of Catan_ game (you'll be 1 short per color) or you can get them here:

* [Wood Roads - PrintPlayGames](https://www.printplaygames.com/product/25mm-x-5mm-x-5mm-wood-roads/)
* [Stick Wood - TheGameCrafter](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/parts/stick-wood-black)

Alternately, you can use any stick-like piece that is 25mm or shorter in length. Longer pieces might work, but you may have trouble fitting the track between some stations on the board.

### 1 sticker sheet

The stores and customers are each labeled with a 1/2" round sticker. These stickers can either be created manually or they can be printed:

* [Sheet of 154 round stickers 1/2"](https://www.avery.com/templates/presta-94503)
* [Image to print on sticker sheet](../stickers/stickers.png)

### 1 bag

The bag is used to hold all the customers so that they can be drawn at random. Use any bag you feel like.

* [Cloth bag - PrintPlayGames](https://www.printplaygames.com/product/cloth-bag/)

### 4 player screens (1 x 4 player colors)

These don't need to be anything fancy, but should be large enough to hide roughly 20 customers.
