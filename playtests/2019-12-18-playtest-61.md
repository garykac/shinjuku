Testing:

* Remove Upgrade action
	* Upgrade during match when that store gains a cuatomer
	* Player pays card but keeps customer
* gain 4 vp for each dept store
* customer queue is expanded based on number of dept stores:

For 2 player:

|        Dept Stores |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |
| ------------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Customers in Queue |  2  |  2  |  3  |  3  |  4  |  4  |  5  |

## Comments

Not losing the customer feels good.

With the Customer sidebar, it is now fairly obvious if someone forgets to place a customer.

* Adam Design Patterh: Upkeep should benefit someone or be exciting

With dept store bonus, for most 2-player games both players will have the same bonus.
