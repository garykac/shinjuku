Ken: initially interpreted the "2" for the queue as "draw 2 new customers"
instead of draw until there are "2" on the queue

Don't need to worry about adding cards tot he queue once last customer is placed

Questions:

How did you feel about how the game started?

Chris:
Never had a problem with 1st few turns
like infra decisions
feels like open market that he can sieze upon

See what he could have done differently

Adam:
Adachi Gambit
assessment of when pivot in 4-player game
	you can get 3 dept stores
in 4 player game, he needed to start collecting earlier


TODO:
Make customers not snap in TTS

Calrify:
You can use wild customer to upgrade to a dept store
