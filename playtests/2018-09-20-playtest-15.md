## Overview

* Testing:
	* 2 player
	* Place a burst of customers when a dept store is built. Burst = 4/3/2 customers for 2/3/4-player
	* 5 diff cards = wildcard

## Components

* 18"x20" board with Map of Tokyo
* 72 Ward cards
* 8/7/6 for 2/3/4-player
* 16/13/10 track for 2/3/4-player
* 2 dept stores per player
* 60 Customer tokens:
	* 19 ◯, 16 ⤫, 14 △, 11 ⭐︎

## Rules

### Setup

* Deal 5 cards to each player

### Turns

Place a random customer at start of turn

Each turn take 2 different actions:

* **Build**: Pay a card, build a store in that ward
* **Upgrade**: Pay a card and a customer, upgrade a store to a dept store
* **Lure**: Pay a card, lure customers from that ward
* **Expand**: Pay any 1 card to build 1 track; pay 3 cards to build 2 connected track
* **Income**: draw up to 5 cards, or draw 1 card if you already have 5 cards. Taking this action ends your turn.

### Final turn

When last customer is placed, everyone takes one additional turn.

Burst of customers worked well and felt good. It wasn't as tedious as adding customers after each regular store.

Targetting ⭐︎ customers worked well as a strategy (because of their limited number).

Using 5 different cards as a wildcard has never been used in a playtest. No need to keep it as a rule.

Being able to move stores serves as an interesting "attack" during late game when you have a lot of wildcards. Play a card to move a store, then play a card to lure customers.

* If there's a need to reduce the frequency of this, then the cost to move a store can be increased to 2 cards: one for the store's current location and then another for it's new location.

Game could have ended a few turns early, so the game needs to consume more customers. Increase the number of customers that arrive in the burst.

I can bump that up to 5 or have 3 dept stores in a 2-player game.
... or both, I suppose.

This playtest was 2 player x 2 dept x 4 customers = 16 customers

Assuming that everyone builds all their dept stores:

* 4 players x 2 dept = 8 events x 3 = 24 customers
* 3 players x 2 dept = 6 events x 4 = 24 customers
* 2 players x 3 dept = 6 events x 4 = 24 customers

## Suggestions/Actions

For next playtest:

* Update dept store burst to 4/4/3 for 2/3/4-player
* Update number of dept stores to 3 in 2-player game
