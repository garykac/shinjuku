Testing:

* 72 customers
	* 23 = 15/8 Food
	* 20 = 13/7 Clothing
	* 16 = 11/5 Books
	* 13 = 9/4 Electronics
* player takes card from sidebar when placing customer
* start with 2 customers in queue
* draw up to 4 cards in hand (changed from 5)
* dept store upgrade payment goes onto sidebar
	* to increase the total number of customers in sidebar
* scoring sets as a +3/+2/+1 bonus on top of the regular customer value

## Comments

The sort order for customers needs to be on the map/screen or somewhere for reference. Since this is used to add customers to the sidebar.

Only drawing up to 4 feels less satisfying than 5. But is that just because I'm used to having 5.

Game took 55 min til end.

## Suggestions/Actions

next:

* test with 72 customers and sidebar
* work on appropriate number of customers to have in queue and how fast that should grow when dept stores are build
