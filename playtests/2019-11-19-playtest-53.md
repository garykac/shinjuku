## Comments

Testing:

* New players

What is the best way to hold cards? Maybe add an Index in the corner.

I: Once network is built, random where the customer arrives

What about final round just assume everyone has 2 wildcards

I: didn't give customers to other players very often

I felt too open, you could avoid other players to easily. Point in middle when you cared about other stores - but you could work around to avoid

I: what about spending 2 cards to upgrade to dept store?
