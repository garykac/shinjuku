## Comments

Playing with princess expansion

Rule reminders (during game):

* Income ends your turn
* Once you start a move, you can stop at any time. Your aren't required to continue
* Be careful with terminology: stations vs stores
* Clarify Move must end with satisfying a customer. Can this info for on the player screen?

Need to fix map to clarify adjacent wards. Example, Ota and Koto.

Would like to be able to pick up customers along the way

Sverre would like more actions. Maybe skip next turn for an extra action. Maybe pay a customer for an extra action
