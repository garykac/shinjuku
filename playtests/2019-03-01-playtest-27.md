## Overview

* Testing:
	* Drawing multiple customers per turn after dept stores are built
	* Only 1 action on first turn for first few players.

## Components & Rules

Baseline rules, except:

* 1 action on first turn for first n/2 players (rounded down)
* Draw 2 customers per turn after 3rd dept store is built
	* This replaces having a burst of customers appear when a dept store is built

Josh

* Board could be darker visually so that the pieces stand out
* Most fun: moving lots of customers
* Dissatisfying when there were few customers

John

* Good balance between complexity and time to play
* The stores could have stickers on both sides so that it is easier to sort them at the beginning of the game.

## Suggestions/Actions

For next playtest:

* Drawing 2 customers after 3 dept stores are build is good.
* Limiting action for first n/2 players is not necessary.
