Q:
Tokens for the bonus dept store build

Testing:
Event cards


Comments on rule:
Must cross track if there are multiple customers.
Happened twice in first few turns.


Events:
Move Track vs Move Customer
choose: Move customer

New Connections vs Relocate Store
choose: RElocate store
can move department store? No
   reconsider?


For events:
Active player goes first
why not last

Adam:
Problem:
What do events do to the tempo of the game
Breaks rhythm
Making decision that you're not prepped for
Changes quick/smooth game - grinds to a halt
every player must stop and make decision

Gary:
Dept store upgrades are rare,
but they often happen quickly in sequence

Adam:
motivated based on comment that game needs pivot at half point
but experienced players already know there's a pivot
but it's implicit

Chris
a lot harder to assess value of some of the crazy cards
Thieves vs. Kaicho

Ken:
Seems like hard pivot

Adam:
Better to go back to just choosing one to play game with

Ken:
Being able to decide on the rules at the beginning of the game
is really nice
Didn't like the board state changing out from underneath
Rug being pulled out from under

Gary
Motivation:
Get familiar with puzzle during first half
Want to change up the puzzle a bit for the 2nd half

Chris:
Could make same argument for Catan
By midpoint, it's not like I'm on cruise control
It's mor elike I've gaind confidence with how to play
And I want to play again

Can accelerate start of game by adding customers on the map
This would give more info

Ken:
Have a hard time with some feedback is taht it feels generic

Medium-light strategy game
Place for that in the market

Chris:
This is a better game than what's currently out there in the
pick up and deliver game
