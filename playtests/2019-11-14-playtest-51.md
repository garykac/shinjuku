## Comments

Testing:

* New action: Move a single customer along a single segment of track - skipping stores
	* Can only move customer if they are alone in ward
	* Idea is to allow customers to be grouped my moving them together

Skipping stores feels odd

A: Does this rule change encourage suboptimal play?

Also, this is degenerate for 2 players:

* Can move customer back and forth
* cf. Ko rules in Go

A: change Move action - must satisfy at least 2 customers. To encourage bigger moves

A: Note: If small Move must follow track, then it can easily be moved back (because there is track).

* Small move is most useful as a 1st move followed by a real move.

New action is not powerful enough to use. Should a more powerful version be added/used?

Perhaps allowing a single customer to be extracted from a group and moved to a neighboring ward.
