## Overview

* Testing:
	* 5-player
	* 10 stores per player: 2 each of ◯, ⤫, △, ▢ and ⭒

## Components

* 18"x20" board with Map of Tokyo
* 72 Ward cards
* 10 stores per player (2 of each type)
* 15 track per player
* 2 dept stores per player
* 45 Customer tokens:
	* 12 ◯, 10 ⤫, 9 △, 8 ▢, 6 ⭒

## Rules

### Setup

* Deal 5 cards to each player

### Initial seeding

Each player seeds 1 customer (for 5-player) and then places a store for free anywhere on the board.

### Turns

Each turn take 2 different actions:

* Pay a card, build a store in that ward
* Pay a card, upgrade a store in that ward
* Pay a card, lure customers from that ward
* Pay any 1 card to build 1 track; pay 3 cards to build 2 connected track
* Take income: draw up to 5 cards, or draw 1 card if you already have 5 cards. Taking this action ends your turn.

### Final turn

When last customer is placed, everyone takes one additional turn (with 2 final actions).

## Comments

Adam played a winning strategy by building a dept store early and then gathering lots of customers.

Game felt too short with 5 players because there were fewer turns per player (8).

We apparently missed some of the customer actions at the end of the player turns, so we need some rules guidance on how to handle that.

* "Whoops, I guess that was your last turn" is not satisying.

The initial setup felt a bit odd because we went from seeding customers at the start of the turn directly into "now we do it at the end". The setup should feel more different from the main game turns.

* Adam's suggestion: Place all customers and then have players choose starting location in reverse-player order.
* Is is possible to remove this setup step entirely? Players would then be at the mercy of their starting cards.

What if players only started with 5 stores?

* To make it more obvious that you need to focus on building dept stores.
* Would this mean that 2-stores become less useful - you don't want to tie up 2 store tokens unless you're planning on upgrading to a dept store. If so, then the 2-spot stations on the map are effectively the same as the 1-spot stations, and we really only need to distinguish between stations that allow a dept store and those that do not.

Need to combine Build and Upgrade into a single action so that you can't Build and Upgrade in a single turn.

Possibly make dept stores more difficult to build:

* By require a min amount of track connecting to the station before a dept store can be built
* e.g., 3 track connected around station. Can be owned by any player.

## Suggestions/Actions

For next playtest:

* Test with only 5 stores per player (one of each type)
* Add more customers (possibly up to 60 for a longer game)
* Adjust initial seeding at start of game
* Combine Build/Upgrade into a single action
