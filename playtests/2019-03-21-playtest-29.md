Josh:

* Like realistic Tokyo map with stations

Ken:

* Likes "tokening" (cf 18xx games)
   * Use tokens/stations to define line, but can be used offensively to block/tax other players
   * Really enjoyed this aspect
  
Adam:

* For resolving ties, look at Knizia's _The Quest for El Dorado_.
   * Have a component that players can acquire that has a strict ranking. In _El Dorado_ these are the dividers between map sections.
   * The ranking of the component should be related to the difficulty in acquiring it. In _El Dorado_, more difficult barriers were worth more for the tie-breaking.
   * For _Shinjuku_, this could be the dept stores. Each of the 12 stores could have a ranking with the better locations being worth less for tie-breaking.

## Suggestions/Actions

For next playtest:

* Customer paid for dept store is removed from game.
