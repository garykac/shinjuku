Testing:

* new players
* 4-player
* Combined Upgrade/Move
	* When you upgrade, add a new customer to the sidebar (from bag)
* Start customer queue with 1 customer, add 1 per department store

## Comments

Starting with only 1 customer feels slow.

Ramp up speed feels fine

During game:

* How many of each card?
* How many times will we shuffle?
* Have we seen them all yet? (the cards)

Sometimes player felt restricted by their cards

Score:

| Player | Color  | Score  |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Ben    | yellow |   36   |
| Joe    | blue   |   35   |
| Aaron  | green  |   29   |
| Mayson | red    |   23   |

What would you do differently next game?

* upgrade to DS earlier

## Suggestions/Actions

next:

* increase customer count
* improve or drop dept store bonus
* keep Move/Upgrade together?
