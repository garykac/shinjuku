## Comments

Testing:

* Updated Tokyo map (additional station in Setagaya)
* Track 9/player with additional neutral track
	* You may use neutral track instead of your track
	* Trying to determine if there can be a set amount of track that doesn't need to be adjusted based on player count.

Rules clarification:

* When double expanding through Yoyogi/Shinjuku, you need to play the card that matches the first track that you placed.
* Move:
	* may stop whereever you satisfy a customer
	* must continue at if you haven't satisfied

Josh: "I don't like this game" "This is a good game"

* note: first comment was expressing frustration with his position, not the game in general ^_^

Used 34 track in total

Possibly require that the 2nd track is neutral (if possible). To remove the decision and streamline game.

J: Should neutral track be available at more cost?

J: Is neutral track (and the decision) good for new players?

J: New player question:

* Where to place track?
* Can hints be placed on the map? Like connect dept stores

Another hint: don't commit to a part of the map too early.

## Suggestions/Actions

Neutral track was interesting, but probably for an expansion.

Next time:

* Department store locations on the map need to be larger - hard to see when covered
