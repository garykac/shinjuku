## Comments

(from Ken)

I changed "Lure" to advertise in my teachings and that was received really well by players. As you and I discussed, language adds a lot to the game. So when someone would say, "I am going to advertise food in Manato." It began to feel really immersive.

* 2- player | 70 mins w/ teach | Score: Ken: 22- Jonathan: 15
	* Played w/ main rules except in phase 2 placed both customers on the same location
	* Phase 2 seemed to drag on forever. Pretty clear who had won 2-3 rounds before game ended

* 3-player | 58 mins w/o teach | Score: Ben: 15, Ken: 11, Jeremy: 9
	* Played with the same ruleset as above
	* Combined Positive Notes
		* Income works really well
		* Three cards for a wild feels good, able to do what you need to. Adaptable
		* Engaging in every person turn
		* Great length and quick turns are nice
		* Forced interaction great
	* Combined Negative Notes
		* Tracks ran out in 3p, felt bad
		* Last round feels like the second action is useless and if you’d don’t have the right card it feels bad. 
		* Station kanji (sp?) too big

* 2-player | 66 mins w/ teach | Score: Ken: 13 - Emily: 13 (Won on having more overall customers)
	* Played with same rulles as above but removed 8 customers, felt like it ended at right time
	* Negative Notes
		* Ran out of track
		* Because of wild rule, feels like late game card draw is less meaningful and bad draws feel bad
		* End feels a little flat because you just advertise (mention lure being weird)
	* Positive Notes
		* "Easy to learn and felt like a better than some of the game you (Ken) have bought."
	* Final Score breakdown
		* E- 6, 4, 4, 5
		* K- 5, 4, 4, 4,
		* E won on more customers overall
   
"...after I removed 8 customers (one of each resource type), the two-player game seemed to end at a much better moment."
