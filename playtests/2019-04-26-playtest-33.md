## Components & Rules

Baseline rules

## Comments

Clarifications:

* When paying a customer to upgrade, pay a single token (double or thief is OK)
* When drawing customers at start of turn, if a thief is drawn, keep drawing until a non-thief is drawn.
* When drawing 2 customers, draw until 2 non-thief customers are drawn.

Jeff:

* Assumed that the customer type to remove during scoring was going to be based on number of tokens rather than number of points.
   
## Suggestions/Actions

For next playtest:

* When scoring, remove customer type that you have the most tokens of (rather than most points)
