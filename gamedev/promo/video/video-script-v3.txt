# Intro

Shinjuku is a game where you
	control one of Tokyo's rail and shopping conglomerates.
In the game, you'll need to
	build a network of track and stores
	and then pick-up-and-deliver customers to your stores
	while avoiding the stores of your opponents

# Components

The game is played on a map of central Tokyo
 	which is divided into 23 "special wards"
Each of these wards contains one or more stations

The game also has a deck of 72 cards
	Each card identifies a single ward on the map

There are 4 kinds of customers in Shinjuku:
	Customers that want to buy food
	Those that want to buy clothing
	And others who want books
	or electronics

Some of the customers are marked with a "2"
	to indicate that they count as 2 customers in endgame scoring

Each customer type has a different number of tokens in the game
And they each have different distributions of single- and double- customers.

# Overview

In Shinjuku, each turn follows the same pattern:
	First, add new customers to the map from the Customer
		Queue on the side of the map
	And then take 2 different player actions

There are 5 actions to choose from, you can:
	Open a new store,
	Upgrade an existing store to a department store,
	Expand your rail connections on the map,
	draw more cards into your hand as Income,
	or Move customers around on the map

# Adding Customers

The game starts with only 2 customers in the queue
But as the game progresses, the number of customers waiting in the queue will increase

When you're adding a new customer
	If it matches a customer already in the queue,
		then place the new customer on the same card the matching customer
	Otherwise, place the customer on the next available card

# Player actions

## Open a new store

To open a new store
Pay card from your hand that matches the location where you want to open
	Place one of your store markers on a station

## Upgrade to department store

if you have built a store on one of the specially marked stations
	you can upgrade it to a department store
To upgrade, simply
	pay a card that matches the store's location
	and a matching customer that you earned previously
the customer is added to the customer queue
	which permanently increases the size of the queue
	so that the game accelerates as department stores are built

When you upgrade to a department store
	Claim the next available upgrade token
	These tokens can be used as wild customers during endgame scoring
	
## Expand track

Adding a new segment of track to the map doesn't cost a card
and you can place the track on any unused connection

Optionally, you may pay a card to place a
	second connected segment of track
The card must match one of the two endpoints of the first segment of track.

## Draw Income

The income action allows you to draw more cards into your hand
When you take this action:
	draw your hand back up to 4 cards
	or draw a single card if you already have 4 or more

## Move customers

The Move action is how you get customers on the map to your stores
The easiest way to explain the Move action is to demonstrate

So let's start with a sample mid-game setup:
	assuming it's the Blue player's turn
Blue wants to move the customers in Minato to the Blue stores
Note that when you Move, you must take *all* of the customers in that location
	So, Blue takes all the customers in Minato
And selects which station to start from
	The obvious choice is Shimbashi station

At each station visited, you need to check to see if there is a store there
	that matches any customers
In Shimbashi, the Blue Clothing store matches the 2 Clothing customers
	But each store can only match one customer at a time
	So Blue can choose either the single or double Clothing customer
Blue takes the remaining 3 customers and moves to Tokyo station
	Red has a dept store here
	A dept store matches all customers, but it can still only accept 1 of them
	Since Blue is performing Move action, Blue gets to choose which one
	Blue chooses to give the Food customer to the Red dept store.
Continuing, Blue moves the remaining 2 customers to Yotsuya station
	where red has an Food store
	sadly, there are no more Food customers, so no customers match
Blue continues on to Shinjuku station
	There are no stores here, so nothing matches
And then continues onward to Meidai Mae station
	Where the Book customer matches the Blue Book store
Here, Blue ends the Move action
	And the remaining Clothing customer is added to Setagaya
Overall:
	Blue ends up with 2 customers
	And Red gets 1 customer
As part of the Move, note that Blue made use of some Red track,
	Whenever you use an opponent's track, they gain a free Income action
	So Red gains Income because of Blue's move

# Wildcards

While there are no explicit wildcards in the deck.
	there are 2 different ways that you can create wildcards

The first way is to:
	Spend any 3 cards from your hand as if they were a single wildcard

Another way to get wildcards is through the stores that you've opened:
	Cards become wildcards for you once you have opened a store in that location.
	For example:
		if you open a store in Akihabara station,
		now the Chiyoda card is wild for you.

# Endgame

The endgame is triggered when the last set of customers is placed on the map from the queue.

Endgame scoring is based entirely on the customers that you acquire during the game

Scoring is basic set collection:
	10 points for every set of 4 different customers
	6 points for every set of 3
	3 points for 2
	and 1 point for every remaining customer
