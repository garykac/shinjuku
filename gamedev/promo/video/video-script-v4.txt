### Goal: Walkthrough video

# Intro

Shinjuku is a game where you
	control one of the rail and shopping conglomerates in Tokyo

In the game, you need to
	build a network of track and stores
	and then pick-up-and-deliver customers to your stores
	while avoiding the stores of your opponents

# Overview

In this video
	we're going to introduce the rules
	by walking through the first few turns of a sample game

## Setup

First, let's set up the game components
	so that we can start the game

The board for Shinjuku is a map of Tokyo

Each player has some track
	some stores
	and some department stores

To set up the game board
	you need to place the 6 upgrade bonus tokens
		in the lower left of the board
and then place the deck of cards someplace accessible to all players

Each card in the deck corresponds to a single ward in Tokyo
	like Chiyoda, Shinjuku or Minato

In the upper right of the board is the Customer Queue
this is where customers will queue up before appearing on the map

To initialize the customer queue at the start of a game
	first, draw 4 cards and place them on the numbered locations
	and then we'll place customers on these cards

There are 4 types of customers in the game
	those that want to buy food,
	those that want clothing,
	and others that want books
	or electronics

Each player has stores corresponding to each of these types

There are also customers marked with a "2"
	these double-customers count as if they were 2 separate tokens in endgame scoring

Note there is a different number of customers for each type
and the distribution of single- vs double-customers varies as well

The goal in the game is to gather as many customers as you can
	you get more points if you collect sets of different customer types

Going back to the customer queue
	we start the game with 2 customers, placed one at a time
If the queue is empty, then the customer is simply placed on the first card in the queue
	So we draw a Book customer and place on the first card, Minato

When there are already customers in the queue
	then you first need to check to see if the customer type matches any customer already in the queue
	if there's a match place the customer with its match
	otherwise, place it on the next available card

		+-------------+
		| Minato      | Book
		+-------------+
		| Shinjuku    | Food
		+-------------+
		| Chuo        |
		+-------------+
		| Taito       |
		+-------------+
In this case, we draw a Food customer and since it doesn't match the existing customer
	we place it on the next card: Shinjuku

Now we just need to deal 4 cards to each player
	and we're ready to begin

Each turn in Shinjuku follows the same pattern:
	first, one or more customers are added to the map from the queue
	then you choose 2 different actions from the following 5:
		open a new store
		upgrade a store to a department store
		expand your rail network by adding track
		draw cards as income
		or, move customers on the map

Now we'll walk through the first few turns of a 2-player game to see how this works

*** =============
*** TURN 1 - BLUE  @ 2:36
*** =============
*** BLUE STARTING CARDS: Katsushika Nerima Itabashi Setagaya

We'll start with the Blue player
	<SHOW BLUE CARDS: Katsushika, Nerima, Itabashi, Setagaya>

Each turn starts with adding customers from the queue
	we do that by taking the customer on the first card
	and placing that customer in that location
	in this case, we take the Book customer and place it in Minato

			+-------------+
			| Minato      | Book -> Map
			+-------------+
			+-------------+
			| Shinjuku    | Food +Food
			+-------------+
			| Chuo        |
			+-------------+
			| Taito       |
			+-------------+
			| Ota         | <-
			+-------------+

And then the Blue player takes the card into their hand

The Customer queue is then refreshed
	by sliding the existing cards over
	and drawing a new card to fill the empty space

Because we placed one customer on the map
	we add one customer to the queue
	the same way we did earlier.

This time we draw a Food customer
	which matches a Food customer already in the queue
	so we place this new customer with the existing one on the Shinjuku card

The Blue player can now take their 2 actions

*** ACTION 1: Open Book store in Shimbashi using Minato card

For the first action, Blue wants to Open a new store in Minato

To open a store, you need to pay a card from your hand
	that matches the location where you want the store
This allows you to open a store in any empty station in that location

So, using the Minato card that they just picked up
	they open a Book store in Shimbashi
	and discard the card that they played

*** ACTION 2: Expand Track from Shimbashi to Tokyo

For the second action, Blue wants to
	add some track using the Expand action
	This action doesn't require a card
	and the track can be placed on any empty connection on the map

Note that only 1 segment of track is needed to connect any 2 stations
	regardless of the distance between the stations


So now blue's turn is over and...

*** BLUE ENDING CARDS: Katsushika Nerima Itabashi Setagaya

*** ============
*** TURN 2 - RED
*** ============
*** RED STARTING CARDS: Edogawa Shinagawa Bunkyo Chiyoda

Red's turn begins with adding customers to the map

The 2 Food customers at the head of the queue are placed in Shinjuku
	and the queue is refreshed

			+-------------+
			| Shinjuku    | Food + Food -> Map
			+-------------+
			+-------------+
			| Chuo        | +Elect2
			+-------------+
			| Taito       | +Food
			+-------------+
			| Ota         |
			+-------------+
			| Nakano      | <-
			+-------------+

Because 2 customers were placed on the map
	2 new customers must be added to the queue

These are added one at a time
	and any duplicates are placed with their match

*** ACTION 1: Open Food store in Shinjuku station using Shinjuku card

For Red's first action, they decide to open a Food store in Shinjuku station
	using the Shinjuku card they just received

*** ACTION 2: Expand track from Tokyo to Yotsuya - double to Shinjuku

Red then decides to add some track
	placing it between Yotsuya and Tokyo stations

*** @ 4:11

When placing track
	you may optionally pay a card to lay a second segment of track
	the card spent needs to match one of the stations connected by the first track segment

*** @ 4:19

Red spends a Chiyoda card, which matches the Tokyo endpoint

*** @ 4:23

When placing a second segment of track
	it must extend from the first segment placed
	but you can extend from either side
	regardless of which side you matched with your card

*** @ 4:31

RED ENDING CARDS: Edogawa Shinagawa Bunkyo

*** =============
*** TURN 3 - BLUE
*** =============
*** BLUE STARTING CARDS: Katsushika Nerima Itabashi Setagaya

On Blue's turn
	a new customer is added to Chuo

			+-------------+
			| Chuo        | Elect2 -> Map
			+-------------+
			+-------------+
			| Taito       | Food
			+-------------+
			| Ota         | +Clothing
			+-------------+
			| Nakano      |
			+-------------+
			| Chuo        | <-
			+-------------+		

And the queue is refreshed with another customer

There's a Book customer in Minato
	and Blue has a Book store there
	so Blue would really like to get that customer

*** ACTION 1: Move Book customer in Minato using 3-card wild

Blue decides to take the Move action
	But the Move action requires that you play a card
	that matches the location where you are moving the customers

Blue needs a Minato card, but doesn't have one

Fortunately, there's a way that Blue can create a match for Minato

By spending 3 cards from their hand
	Blue can create a Wildcard that can be used to match any location

*** Wildcard: Katsushika,Nerima,Itabashi

So Blue spends 3 cards from their hand
	and Moves the customers in Minato
	
When moving customers
	you first take all the customers in that location
		(you can't choose a subset)
	and then you choose which station you would like to start from

There are 4 stations to start from in Minato
	but only one of them is relevant at this point
	so Blue starts in Shimbashi
	where they (conveniently) have a Book store

The customer matches the store,
	so Blue takes the Book customer
This customer will be used later in endgame scoring

*** ACTION 2: Income

For Blue's second action, they decide to Draw Income
This allows them to draw their hand back up to 4 cards
	or to draw an additional card if they already have 4 or more cards

*** Draw Chiyoda, Minato

*** BLUE ENDING CARDS: Setagaya Chuo Chiyoda Minato

*** ============
*** TURN 4 - RED @ 5:44
*** ============
*** RED STARTING CARDS: Edogawa Shinagawa Bunkyo

On Red's turn
	a new Food customer is added to Taito

			+-------------+
			| Taito       | Food -> Map
			+-------------+
			+-------------+
			| Ota         | Clothing
			+-------------+
			| Nakano      | +Book2
			+-------------+
			| Chuo        |
			+-------------+
			| Shibuya     | <-
			+-------------+

	and a double-book customer is added to the queue

*** ACTION 1: Move Food customers in Shinjuku

Red would like to move the customers in Shinjuku
	But they don't have a Shinjuku card
	so they also need to spend 3 cards to make a wildcard

*** Wildcard: Edogawa Shinagawa Bunkyo

This allows them to pick up the 2 Food customers
Note that because there is more than 1 customer being Moved
	the customers must move across at least one segment of track

So Red picks up the Food customers
	and starts them in Shinjuku station

Even though both customers match the store
	Each store can only match one customer at a time
	so Red gives one of the customers to the store

Since the remaining customer must travel across at least one segment of track
	Red moves them over to Yotsuya

At this point, Red can choose to either
	stop here
	or continue along more track
Red decides to stop here and drop the customer back in Shinjuku

In this case, the remaining customer is dropped back in the same location
	where they started
But usually when they cross a track they will end up in a neighboring location

*** @ 6:40
*** ACTION 2: Open Food store in Taito

For Red's second action, they spend their last card
	to open a Food store in Taito

*** RED ENDING CARDS: <none>

*** =============
*** TURN 5 - BLUE @ 6:45
*** =============
*** BLUE STARTING CARDS: Setagaya Chuo Chiyoda Minato

The new customer that arrivers on Blue's turn wants Clothing and is placed in Ota

			+-------------+
			| Ota         | Clothing -> Map
			+-------------+
			+-------------+
			| Nakano      | Book2 +Book
			+-------------+
			| Chuo        |
			+-------------+
			| Shibuya     |
			+-------------+
			| Nakano      | <-
			+-------------+

The customer that is drawn into the queue is a Book customer
	so it is placed on the card with the existing Book customer

*** @ 6:54
*** ACTION 1: Open Food store in Chiyoda

Blue would like to get that remaing Food customer in Shinjuku

So Blue uses a Chiyoda card to build a Food store

*** @ 7:01
*** ACTION 2: Move Food from Yotsuya -> Tokyo (Minato as wild)

To move the customers
	Blue could spend 3 cards to make a wildcard
But there is another way to create wildcards

Every location on the map where you have a store (or department store)
	is a wildcard for you

Blue currently has stores in Chiyoda and Minato
	which means that Blue can use the Minato card as a wildcard
	to match any location

So Blue spends the Minato card
	to Move the customers in Shinjuku

Blue chooses to start from Yotsuya to avoid the Red Food store.
	and follows the Red track over to the Blue Food store in Chiyoda

This gives Blue the Food customer

Recall that Blue made use of Red's track during this Move
	whenever you use another player's track during your Move action
	that player may immediately draw Income
	Note that only 1 Income draw is triggered per player
		regardless of how many segments of track were used during the Move.

*** BLUE ENDING CARDS: Setagaya Chuo Ota

*** ============
*** TURN 6 - RED @ 7:45
*** ============
*** RED STARTING CARDS: Suginami Koto Meguro Nerima

Even though Red ended last turn with no cards
	because of the bonus Income from Blue's Move,
	Red now has a full hand of 4 cards

Red takes the 2 Book customers from the queue
	places them in Nakano
	
			+-------------+
			| Nakano      | Book2 + Book -> Map
			+-------------+
			+-------------+
			| Chuo        | +Clothing
			+-------------+
			| Shibuya     | +Elect2
			+-------------+
			| Nakano      |
			+-------------+
			| Shinagawa   | <-
			+-------------+

	and draws 2 replacement customers

*** @ 7:59
*** ACTION 1: Upgrade Food store in Shinjuku to a department store

Red's first action is to upgrade their Food store in Shinjuku
	to a department store
	
Note that only certain stations on the map
	can be upgraded to a department.
	These stations are marked with a Sakura icon.
	Unsurprisingly, Shinjuku station is one of those marked locations

Since Red doesn't have a Shinjuku card,
	they will once again need to spend 3 cards to make a wildcard

When upgrading to a department store
	You need to pay a card that matches the location
	but you also need to pay a customer
		that matches the store type that you're upgrading

So in this case,
	Red needs to give up a Food customer that they've earned previously

The spent customer is added to the Customer Queue
	permanently increasing the number of customers in the queue

The department store token replaces the store token on the map
	and you take the store back so that you can use it again

*** @ 8:43

When you upgrade a store to a department store
	you should the next available Upgrade Bonus token
	these tokens are used during endgame scoring

*** @ 8:50
*** ACTION 2:

Red's second action is to add some more track extending out to Nakano

	
*** =============
*** TURN 7 - BLUE @ 8:55 
*** =============
*** BLUE STARTING CARDS: Setagaya Chuo Ota

At the start of Blue's turn
	another customer is added to Chuo
	adding to the customer already there
	
			+-------------+
			| Chuo        | Clothing -> Map
			+-------------+
			+-------------+
			| Shibuya     | Elect2
			+-------------+
			| Nakano      | Food (from upgrade)
			+-------------+
			| Shinagawa   | +Book
			+-------------+
			| Suginami    | <-
			+-------------+

Blue's hand now contains 2 Chuo cards
	and Blue can use them to make a new wildcard

ACTION 1: Open Clothing store in Chuo

Using one of the two Chuo cards
	Blue can open a Clothing store

Since every location where you have a store is wild for you
	the remaining Chuo card is now a wildcard

ACTION 2:

The second Chuo card can now be used
	to pick up the customers in Nakano

The Move starts in Nakano station
	and crosses the red track over to Red's department store in Shinjuku
	
A department store can match one of any kind of customer
	so Red will definitely get one of these customers
	but Blue gets to choose which one

Blue chooses to give Red the single Book customer

And then continues down the track over to Chiyoda
	and down to Minato, passing by the Food store

The move ends at the Blue Book store

Both Book customers are claimed
	Blue gets the double Book customer
	while Red gets the regular Book customer

Also, Blue made use of at least one Red track
	so Red also gets to draw Income


======

So that introduces all of the rules.
Let's skip ahead to the end of the game
to see how that plays out

======

When the last customer is drawn from the bag
	it is placed in queue as usual

The game continues until last card is removed from the queue

While the queue is draining,
	if a store is Upgraded during this time
	the customer is still added to the queue as usual
	which may extent the game for an extra turn

When the last set of customers is removed from the queue
	and placed on the map
	that player finishes their turn
	and then the game enters the Final Round

In the Final Round
	each player (including the one who placed the final customers)
	takes one last turn

During the Final Round
	you take two different actions (as usual)
	but you do not need to spend a card to perform any of the actions

Basically, you take your turn as if you had
	as many wildcards as you need to perform the actions that you want

Because cards are not used during the final round
	they simply be discarded


Final Round
===========

At the start of the Final Round
	the Customer Queue is closed (all cards removed)
	and every player discards all their cards
	since they won't be used

And then every player takes one more turn
	ending with the player that placed the last customers

During the Final Round
	players take two differents actions as usual
	but cards do not need to be paid for perform any action

any customers paid as part of a department store upgrade
	are simply removed from the game
	since the customer queue is closed.

Scoring
=======

Scoring is based on set collection:

For every set of 4 customers, you receive 10 points
For every set of 3, you get 6 points
Every set of 2 is 3 points
And every remaining customer is worth 1 point.

Double customers count as if they were 2 separate tokens of that type.

The upgrade bonus tokens that you receive when you Upgrade to a department store
	provide an endgame scoring bonus
	acting like a wild customer
	
For each of the Upgrade Bonus tokens you earned:
	you may choose what type you want that token to be
	and then it is worth 1 of that type for each star on the Bonus token


Winner is the player with the most points

If there's a tie,
	the player who first claimed an Upgrade Bonus token is the winner
