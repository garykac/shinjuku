Script Outline Draft v2a

Goal: Short video describing how to play the game

Max 4 or 5 min, shorter is better

# Intro

* Shinjuku is a game where you
	* control one of Tokyo's rail and shopping conglomerates.
* In the game, you need to
	* build a network of track and stores
	* and then pick-up-and-deliver customers to your stores
	* while avoiding the stores of your opponents

# Overview

## The Map

* The game is played on a map of central Tokyo
	* which is divided into 23 "special wards"
	* like Shinjuku, Chiyoda or Minato
* Each of these wards contains one or more stations
* And these stations have connections to other stations
	* where track can be built

* Some of the stations are marked with a Sakura
	* to identify them as locations
	* that can be upgraded to a department store

## The Cards

* The game also has a deck of 72 cards
	* Each card identifies a single ward on the map

* there are multiple copies of each card in the deck
	* Wards with higher population (like Edogawa) have a higher card count
	* than less populated wards (like Sumida)

## Customers

* There are 4 types of customers in Shinjuku:
	* Customers that want to buy food
	* Those that want to buy clothing
	* And others who want books
	* or electronics

* Some of the customers are marked with a "2"
	* to indicate that they count as 2 customers in endgame scoring

* Each customer type has a different number of tokens in the game
* And they each have different distributions of single- and double- customers.

* Each player has stores available that can provide the goods that these customers want
* And also department stores which can provide any of these goods.

## Gameplay

* In Shinjuku, each turn follows the same pattern:
	* First, add new customers to the map from the Customer Queue on the side of the map
	* And then take 2 different player actions

* There are 5 actions to choose from, you can:
	* Open a new store,
	* Upgrade an existing store to a department store,
	* Expand your rail connections on the map,
	* draw more cards into your hand as Income,
	* or Move customers around on the map

We'll discuss each of these actions in more detail

# Adding Customers to the Map

* Each turn starts with customers being placed on the map

* These customers are taken from the customer queue
	* which is located in the upper right of the game board

* At the start of the game,
	* 4 cards are put in the queue
	* along with 2 customers

* The game starts with only 2 customers in the queue
* But as the game progresses, the number of customers waiting in the queue will increase

* When you're adding a new customer
	* If it matches a customer already in the queue,
		* then place the new customer on the same card the matching customer
	* Otherwise, place the customer on the next available card

* At the beginning of your turn,
	* take the customers at the head of the queue
	* and place them in the location identified by the card
* after the customers are placed.
	* take the card into your hand

* and refresh the queue by
	* sliding the cards over and drawing a new card
	* and then replacing the customers that were just placed on the map
* in this case, since we placed 3 customers on the map
	* we need to add 3 new customers to the queue

# Player Actions

* Once the new customers are placed on the map
* You takes 2 actions

## Open a new store

* pay card from your hand that matches the location where you want to build
* place one of your store markers on a station
* stores can only be opened in stations that don't already have a store

## Upgrade to department store

* if you have built a store on one of the specially marked stations
	* you can upgrade it to a department store
* you can only perform this action after you have acquired some customers
* To upgrade, simply
	* pay a card that matches the store's location
	* and a matching customer that you earned previously
* the customer is added to the customer queue
	* which permanently increases the size of the queue
	* so that the game accelerates as department stores are built
* After upgrading,
	* claim the next Upgrade Bonus token
	* which will be used when scoring

## Expand track

Adding a new segment of track to the map doesn't cost a card
and you can place the track on any unused connection

After placing a track segment, you may optionally
	pay a card that matches either endpoint
	to place a second segment of track that extends the first one.

## Draw Income

The income action allows you to draw more cards into your hand
When you take this action:
	draw your hand back up to 4 cards
	or draw a single card if you already have 4 or more

## Move customers

* The Move action is how you get customers on the map to your stores
* The easiest way to explain the Move action is to demonstrate
* So let's start with a sample mid-game setup:
	* Here, the blue player has:
		* A Clothing store in Shimbashi station
		* A Book store in Meidai Mae station
		* And some track
	* The Red player has:
		* A Food store in Yotsuya station
		* A department store in Tokyo station
		* And some track
	* And finally, there are 4 customers in Minato:
		* A customer that wants Food
		* Two that want Clothing
		* And another that wants Books

An important thing to note about customer placement
	is that the customers are in Minato,
	but they are not associated with any particular station

## Blue Example

* Let's start by assuming it's the Blue player's turn
* Blue wants to move the customers in Minato to the Blue stores
* Note that when you Move, you must take *all* of the customers in that location
	* You can't select a subset
	* So, Blue takes all the customers in Minato
* And selects which station to start from
	* The obvious choice is Shimbashi station
* At each station visited, you need to check to see if there is a store there that matches any customers
* In Shimbashi, the Blue Clothing store matches the 2 Clothing customers
	* But each store can only match one customer at a time
	* So Blue can choose either the single or double Clothing customer
* At this point, Blue *could* choose to stop the Move action here
	* and end their action with one Clothing customer 
* But Blue really wants to match the Book customer
	* so Blue continues
	* even though it means that they must pass through some stations with Red stores
* Blue takes the remaining 3 customers and moves to Tokyo station
	* Red has a dept store here
	* A dept store matches all customers, but it can still only accept 1 of them
	* Since Blue is performing Move action, Blue gets to choose which one
	* Blue chooses to give the Food customer to the Red dept store.
* Continuing, Blue moves the remaining 2 customers to Yotsuya station
	* where red has an Food store
	* sadly, there are no more Food customers, so no customers match
* Blue continues on to Shinjuku station
	* There are no stores here, so nothing matches
* And then continues onward to Meidai Mae station
	* Where the Book customer matches the Blue Book store
* Here, Blue ends the Move action
	* And the remaining Clothing customer is added to Setagaya
* Overall:
	* Blue ends up with 2 customers
	* And Red gets 1 customer
* As part of the Move, note that Blue made use of some Red track,
	* Whenever you use an opponent's track, they gain a free Income action
	* So Red gets an Income because of Blue's move

## Red Player

* Let's reset the customers and see how this might have played out if it was Red's turn instead of Blue's
* Red could also choose to start at Shimbashi station
	* giving Blue a Clothing customer
* And then continue to the dept store in Tokyo station
	* Here, Red could take the Clothing customer
* And then continue onward to Yotsuya station
	* And take the Food customer
* Ending here:
	* The remaining Clothing customer is placed in Shinjuku.
	* Red ends up with 2 customers
	* While Blue gets 1 customer
	* Here, Red made use of Blue track, so Blue would get to draw card income

* But remember that each player takes 2 actions on each turn
	* So Red could use their first action to build a rail connection between Roppongi and Yotsuya stations
	* This allows Red to start their Move in Roppongi station
		* Avoiding the Blue Clothing store
	* Continuing on to
		* Yotsuya - Red would take a Food customer
	* And then on to Tokyo - Red would take a Clothing customer
	* In this way, Red gets 2 customers and gives Blue nothing.

# Wildcards

There is a limited number of each card in the deck
	and this can make it hard to get the exact card you want.

If would be nice if there were wildcards that you could play as if they were any card

While there are no explicit wildcards in the deck.
	there are 2 different ways that you can create wildcards

The first way is to:
	Spend any 3 cards from your hand as if they were a single wildcard

Another way to get wildcards is through the stores that you build:
	Cards become wildcards for you once you have built a store in that location.
	For example:
		build a store in Akihabara station, and now the Chiyoda card is wild for you.

So as the game progresses
	it becomes more likely that you will draw a wildcard

# Scoring

* The endgame is triggered when the last set of customers is placed on the map from the queue.
* There is a Final Round where everyone takes one last turn
	* and then the customers are scored.

* Endgame scoring is based entirely on the customers that you acquire during the game

* Scoring is basic set collection:
	* 10 points for every set of 4 different customers
	* 6 points for every set of 3
	* 3 points for 2
	* and 1 point for every remaining customer
* Double customers count as if they were 2 separate tokens

* Each Upgrade Bonus token can be chosen to be any customer type
	* they count as single- double- or triple- of that type.

* Winner is the player with the most points.
