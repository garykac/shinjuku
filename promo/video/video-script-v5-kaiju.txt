### Shinjuku - Kaiju Expansion
###

# Intro

The Kaiju is 


At the start of the game, the Kaiju starts in Tokyo Bay

During your turn, you have an additional action available to you:
	The Kaiju Action
	
This action allows you to move the Kaiju
	from its current location
	into a neighboring location

To move the Kaiju,
	you need to play a card that matches its current location

Since there is no Tokyo Bay card in the game
	the very first time you move the Kaiju
	you need to use a wildcard to match its location

When the Kaiju moves into a new location,
	the following things happen

First, any customers there are scared into a neighboring location
	You choose one of the neighboring location
	and then all the customers go as a group to that location

Second, while the Kaiju is there
	no one can Build, Upgrade or Move through any of the stations in that location
	you also cannot build any track that connects to any of those stations
	
## Adding Customers on top of the Kaiju

When new customers are being added to the board
If they are going to be placed in the location with the Kaiju
	then the player first moves the Kaiju before the customers are placed
