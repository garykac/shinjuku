Luring Customers: When customers are placed on the map, they are assigned to a ward but are not associated with any station. When you take the Lure action, you take all the customers in the ward, choose their starting station (within that ward) and then move them along connections visiting stores along the way.
At each station along their path, if there is a store that matches what a customer desires, that customer must visit the store (and the customer token is given to the player that owns the store). 
The customers can be moved as far as you want along the connections subject to the following limitations: No station may be visited twice; The final station visited must have a store that satisfies a customer. 
Any remaining customers who did not match stores along the way are moved out of the final station and into the ward, merging with any existing customers there.
