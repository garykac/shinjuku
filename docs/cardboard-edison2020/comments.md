Here's the full feedback from the judges:

### Judge 1:

##### What was the game's strongest point?

I'm pleased to see what seems to be a really well-researched basis for the game. It's an interesting and different take on train / pick up and deliver games.

##### What was the game's weakest point?

I worry that you have some dominant strategy issues here, where certain moves are strictly better than others. This functionally eliminates player choices and they end up playing the best-move algorithm. From this cursory view, I am not able to see anything that creates tough choices in the game and I encourage you to look for ways to make your players struggle with decisions.

##### Any additional comments?

Games of this sort succeed and fail based on the strategies and choice dynamics around track placement. I dig the card draw for track use (income) mechanic, I don't think I've seen anything function quite like that before where the reward is options rather than score or currency. It's both less explicitly supportive of the second party track layer and more attractive as a benefit. I think you've got a really solid foundation here, but in addition to the concerns laid out above, I would like to see some further differentiation between your game and other train/pickup-deliver games.

### Judge 2:

##### What was the game's strongest point?

I am impressed with the math and the strategic thinking created by the board layout; strategic placement of stores/routes, and the puzzle aspect of figuring the best route.

##### What was the game's weakest point?

My biggest fear is how much upkeep players will take on an individual turn. There are alot of move and combinations a player will potentially consider, leading to long wait times between turns. My concern will be less if you have found in your playtests that people negotiate with each other as a player is deciding upon their best path. If that happens, then players are still actively engaging the game, even when the round is not their turn.

##### Any additional comments?

If players are not actively conversing with each other, I think you game would work better as an app game then as a board game, since you can setup the app to notify the next player the start of their next turn, so they can do something while waiting for other players to figure out their best move.

### Judge 3:

##### What was the game's strongest point?

I had the pleasure of seeing this pitch at BGG.con and thought it was good there as well. I enjoyed how the players are trying to move the customers along the rails and stores they construct while trying to avoid helping their opponents in their endeavors. The decisions are fairly straight forward, but the strategic options are highly present.

##### What was the game's weakest point?

I would be curious to explore other methods of scoring besides just customer set collection. Games are more successful when they have multiple paths to victory. Also, this game has a random element to it (the draw) and wondered if that could be managed better. That would increase the strategic depth just a tad.

##### Any additional comments?

This is game I would love to try. As a fan of Ticket to Ride, this would definitely be in my wheelhouse!

### Judge 4:

##### What was the game's strongest point?

I like the mechanic where more customers are added to the queue when department stores are built. Its a clever way to ramp the game up.

##### What was the game's weakest point?

The set collection points at the end seem like messy math. Have you considered just scoring your smallest category (like a knizia game)?

##### Any additional comments?

### Judge 5:

##### What was the game's strongest point?

Deep strategy game with solid mechanics and interesting theme.

##### What was the game's weakest point?

The train routes are interesting and I wonder if players ever negotiate in 3-4 player games and if so, how does that affect the overall game.

##### Any additional comments?

I would like to play this. Best of luck!
