Tokyo is a city of trains and Shinjuku is the busiest train station in the world.

â€©Unlike most passenger rail systems, Tokyo has dozens of companies running competing rail lines rather than having a single entity that manages rail for the entire city.
Many of these companies are large conglomerates that own not only the rail, but also the major department stores at the rail stations.

In Shinjuku, you build stores and the rail lines to connect them so that you can build the most successful shopping/rail conglomerate.

Every turn, new customers will arrive on the map looking to purchase one of 4 different goods. On your turn, you choose 2 different actions from: (a) Build a store, (b) Expand your rail, (c) Upgrade to a department store, (d) draw cards as Income or (e) Move customers along the rail to stores.

You start with a hand of 5 location cards. The Build, Upgrade and Move actions require that you play a matching location card from your hand. Cards in your hand that match locations where you have previously built a store are Wild and can be used to match any location.

The game ends when the last customer is placed (+ one final round) and victory goes to the player that acquired the most customers.
