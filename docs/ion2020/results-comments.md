|  9  | Looks like a great medium-light strategy game | |
|  8  | A very unique and distinctive take on train games and resource management. | My only concern (and it's an odd one) is that the reality shown in the game is very very foreign to western ideas. Creating train lines to promote and deliver people to the malls/stations you are building is just a conflict of two very different game mechanic worlds. If the game presentation can over come this, this may be a hit. |
|  8  | Love the building mechanisms and the map seems tight which is good. | |

|  6  | Seems like a nice game involving network building, an economic engine, and a good scoring system. | I have seen this many times before. I do not feel that the design offers something that truly stands out. In today's competitive world of game design, the game needs to be more than just "nice". |

|  4  | A slightly different take on a pick up and deliver train game. | Still nothing really new here. |
