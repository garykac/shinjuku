# INTRO

This video describes Shinjuku, a pick-up and deliver boardgame for 2-5 players
that plays in about 1 hour.

The game is set in Tokyo where you build stores and construct rail connections throughout the
city so that you can move customers to your stores.

The object of the game is to acquire the most customers.

# GAMEPLAY

The gameplay for Shinjuku is straightforward:
Each turn, a new customer randomly appears on the map, and then you choose two
different actions from a set of 5 actions.

Most of the available actions are what you would expect: build a new store or upgrade an existing store,
build more rail connections, or draw more cards.

But the LURE action is special and forms the core of the game.
This is the action that allows you to move customers to your store so that you can use them for endgame scoring.

The best way to describe the LURE action is to set up a mid-game scenario and 
see how a LURE action might play out.

# LURE ACTION DESC

In this example, the blue player has 2 stores and some rail and the red player also has
2 stores and some rail.

There are also some customers on the maps as follows.

# OTHER ACTIONS

As mentioned earlier, there are 5 possible actions with LURE being the most
important for scoring.

The other actions are:

BUILD - Spend a card that matches the area containing the station where you want to build
a store.

EXPAND - Spend 1 card to build 1 segment of track; or spend 3 cards to build 2 connected
segments.

UPGRADE - Spend a matching card and sacrifice one of your customers to upgrade an
existing store to a department store.

INCOME - Draw your hand back up to 5 cards

# GAME ECONOMY

The basic game economy in Shinjuku is from cards to stores to customers (which serve
as victory points at the end of the game).

To remove the tedium of shuffling around small amounts of cash throughout the game,
there is no explicit money in Shinjuku.
Instead, the cards serve as a currency since you spend them to perform actions.
As the game progresses, you become "richer" in the sense that your cards are more
valuable and you draw cards more frequently.
